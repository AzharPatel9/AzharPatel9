Aspiring Data Analyst
---------------------

I live in London more specifically Hackney I have a BA hons in 3D Games Art from Uni of Hertfordshire I have been looking to get into the world of data, so i have been doing a bootcamp with JUSTIT, which believe has allowed me to develop the skills needed to enter the field even though I have no experience in this field, I believe that with my varied experience and soft skills developed I can excel in the field of data. 

Now I have experience working in different sectors; Retail, customer service, Construction, Design, each job where I had to build strong relationships with both my colleagues and clients/customers. what I've noticed doing these jobs is that they consist of small tedious task when need to be done to near perfection. So the ability to be organised, focusing on the small details of things and developed a rigid routine/methodology, a process that when you stick to it will get the job done.....However this is not always the case. 

Working in these different environments, which has given me varied tasks, in roles and responsibilities, has allowed me to be versatile. In more than one occasions I've had to be adaptable no matter the circumstance, as anything can happen. I would find myself having to take the initiative, reading the situation, and resolving that situation to attain the needed outcome of that situation. Through this I've learn to develop active listening skills, and having a positive-can do attitude has allowed me to perform well in these circumstances.

Now just a bit about myself, I am what you would call a social introvert, something I've learned to develop during my life, I keep a small close knit of friends I've known for years, who I keep close to my heart. These relationships I value most. I love Blues music, the concept of being able to say a lot while not saying anything, and even when words are sang, the power to evoke emotions while saying the simplest of words has always fascinated me. Lastly....i love video games.
